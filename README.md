## Bash Scripting - Automated backup script

A great project to build while learning bash scripting is a backup script that automates the process of backing up important files on a local machine to a remote server or cloud storage.

With this project, you'll learn important bash scripting skills like file management, input/output processing, compression, secure data transfer, and automation. Once completed, you can publish the script for others to use or customize for their own backup needs.

*Here's an outline of the steps involved in building the script:*

* Determine the files or directories that need to be backed up, and decide on the backup destination (e.g. remote server, cloud storage).
* Write a script to create a compressed archive of the selected files or directories.
* Set up a secure connection to the backup destination (e.g. SSH for a remote server, API key for cloud storage).
* Write a script to transfer the compressed archive to the backup destination.
* Schedule the script to run automatically at regular intervals (e.g. daily, weekly) using cron.
